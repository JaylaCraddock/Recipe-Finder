    <h1>Who we are</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Jayla Craddock and I am the creator of Mother's Recipes. I made this website for my semester
      project in my Intermediate Web Programming Class of Fall of 2025. Using an API, you're able to find recipes from
      entering ingredients into the search bar. For example, entering an ingredient that you want to make that involves
      limes. Once entered into the search bar it will take you to another page called results that shows the results of
      recipes that uses limes. With the case of using limes, you see a recipe that you may want to make such as a Key
      Lime Pie. When you click on the image of the Key Lime Pie it will take you to another page called Details. That
      provides the ingredients, steps, images of the Key Lime Pie and name. In some cases if available there will be a
      youtube video provided at the bottom for visual learners. </p>
  </article>

  <p>
    In contrast, there is a case if the user doesn't know what to cook. Then there is a section in the website that is
    called Meals where the user clicks on it and is taken to a page that provides a random selection of 20 meals. That
    are rotated on a monthly basis. From there, the user can browse through the selection until they find something that
    piques their interest. For instance, a customer doesn't know what to cook so they look at the meal selection and
    find that they want to make pancakes from the monthly selection. It is the same process as before with
    the search function. With the user clicking on the image of the meal to be taken to the same page where it shows all
    the necessary details. This is one of my favorite projects to make and it was a delight to challenge myself to use
    javascript for most of the part as I am still new to using it. Overall, I have learned a lot from javascript and how
    it functions and I plan on using it in the future to make my websites more interactive.</p>
